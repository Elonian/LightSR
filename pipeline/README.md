# Lightweight Model Integration (Future Development)

## Overview

This folder is reserved for **future development** aimed at integrating **lightweight models** into the existing **detection and segmentation pipeline**.

The goal is to explore and incorporate models that offer:
- Faster inference times
- Lower memory usage
- Suitability for edge and real-time deployment scenarios

## Planned Features

- Integration of lightweight object detection models (e.g., YOLOv7-Tiny, MobileNet-SSD)
- Integration of lightweight semantic/instance segmentation models (e.g., DeepLabV3-MobileNet, Fast-SCNN)
- Modular design for easy plug-and-play usage with existing pipelines
- Benchmarking tools to compare performance and accuracy trade-offs

## Status

**Under Development**  
No functional code is currently available in this directory. This space is intended for incremental work on lightweight model support.
