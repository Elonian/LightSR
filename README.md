# LightSR: Lightweight and Efficient Image Super-Resolution

LightSR is a compact and efficient Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) framework designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones, drones, and embedded systems. Built on SRConvNet, a Transformer-style convolutional architecture with Fourier-modulated attention and dynamic convolution, LightSR strikes a balance between reconstruction quality and model compactness.

This project was developed as part of **ECE 285** at UC San Diego.

# Project Presentation (285 Evaluation)

We present **LightSR** as part of our final project for ECE 285 at UC San Diego. The presentation highlights the motivation, architecture, training setup, evaluation results, and key takeaways from our work on lightweight image super-resolution.
